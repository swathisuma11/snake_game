       <p class="rules"><b>Game Play:</b><br></p>
        <ul class="rules">
            <li><b>Boundary Blues:</b> The boundaries are off-limits! If your snake touches the edge of the screen, it will get a bonk on the head and the game will be over.</li>
            <li><b>Self-Hugging is Dangerous:</b> Your snake loves itself a bit too much. If it touches its own body, it will get tangled up and the game will end.</li>
            <li><b>Snake Growth:</b> Every time your snake eats a piece of red food, it grows longer. The more it eats, the longer it gets, and the harder it is to navigate!</li>
            <li><b>Speedy Snake:</b> With each piece of food eaten, your snake gets a bit faster. Be prepared for the speed increase!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scroll down and enjoy guiding your clumsy snake through its red food-filled adventure!</p>
